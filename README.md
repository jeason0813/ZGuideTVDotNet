## Important Notes

- Since 1.7 beta 2 the setup wizard includes both 32-bit and 64-bit ZGuideTV.NET.
- Before downloading, please, check the release notes and/or if new nightly build to see if some associated files are available. These may contain fixes for serious bugs.
- ZGuideTV.NET is a stand-alone application. This is not an add-on or a plug-in, and can operate independently of any other application.
- An XMLTV sample file is provided with ZguideTV.NET, but you will have to build your own localised files, or have a contract with a XMLTV files provider, to perform future updates.
- Both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures are supported.
